## Abstract 
The DCT is a Fourier-related transform, that expresses a finite sequence of values in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies. It is vastly used in the image processing field, mostly for compression related tasks, such as in JPEG, a lossy format. Lossy compression permits reconstruction of an approximation of the original data, but reduces file size when compared to lossless formats, such as BMP (bitmap).
